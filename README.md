# RingsOfRealm

The purpose of this project, titled "Realm of Rings", is to provide a React and TypeScript-based web application that provides information about the epic saga of the "Lord of the Rings" franchise. The information includes a list of movies, characters, and quotes from the series. Styling is done using Tailwind CSS.

This project is based on vite, a build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience. It's main features are instantaneous server start-up and hot module replacement (HMR) and true on-demand compilation.

## Features
- Home: The Home page displays a welcome message.
- Movies: The Movies page provides a list of all the movies in the franchise.
- Characters: The Characters page provides a list of all the characters in the franchise.
- Quotes: The Quotes page lists all the quotes from the series, fetched from an external API.

## Tech Stack
- ReactJS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: An open-source language that builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
- Vite: A next-generation frontend tooling that provides faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
