## Overview
The purpose of this project is to build a React application that features information about the fantasy world depicted in the "Lord of the Rings" series. The application will have several pages, including a home page, a page listing movies, a page listing characters, and a page listing famous quotes.

## UI Design
Navbar
The Navbar component forms the header of the application. It includes the application title ("Realm of Rings") which also serves as a link to the homepage, and a list of navigation links. The navigation links are for "Home", "Movies", "Characters", and "Quotes". These links take the user to the respective pages of the application. The navigation links collapse into a hamburger menu on smaller screens, providing a responsive design.

Quotes
The Quotes component forms the content of the quotes page. It fetches a list of quotes from an external API and displays them in a paginated format. Each quote is displayed in a card-like format with a decorative background. There are pagination controls that allow the user to navigate through the different pages of quotes. The controls include buttons to go to the first page, previous page, next page, last page, and specific pages.

## Technical Design
State Management
The application makes use of React's useState hook for local state management. The Navbar component uses state to manage the visibility of the navigation links on smaller screens. The Quotes component uses state to manage the list of quotes, the current page, total pages, and the page group for pagination.

## Side Effects
React's useEffect hook is used for managing side effects. The Quotes component uses this hook to fetch data from an external API whenever the current page changes. The response data is used to update the state variables for the list of quotes and the total number of pages.

## Networking
Networking is done using the Fetch API to make GET requests to an external API that provides information about the "Lord of the Rings" series. The Quotes component uses these requests to fetch a list of quotes with pagination.

## Future Enhancements
As a future enhancement, more features can be added to the application such as a details page for each quote, movie, and character, a search function, and more.

## Conclusion
This design document gives a brief description of the "Realm of Rings" application. The application uses the React library for building the UI, state management, and side effects, and the Fetch API for networking. The UI is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
